      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> The Dorms</h3>
      <ul>
        The campus itself was stunning and so were the dorms. Everywhere you went was extremely clean even if it was an older building. In my four years in the university I lived in two dorms which
        were Dinallo Heights and the Village. Dinallo was a traditional dorm style which meant as soon as you walk in it's just a room with a bathroom, that's it. Although it doesn't seem like much
        it was actually really awesome. It was a very modern building which included lounges on every floor and games. Definitely a place for the younger students to hang out anf make friends. The
        Village on the other side was much different. A apartment style dorm which was where the older students and graduate students stayed at. It was less monitored since everyone was older
        so they knew how to behave themselves. Both were great dorms, each with different vibes but for sure worth every single penny paid.

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Campus Life</h3>
      <ul>
          Campus is huge, the 2nd biggest campus in New Jersey. There was always something to do which was awesome. Even when I was younger and was trying to find clubs and activies when not I wasn't in
          class there was always an event to go to. They ranged from educational events to Greek life to just fun things to do. One of my favorites was during midterms/finals week.
          It was an event called Furry Friends. It would be a day that they would bring animals for us to play with to help us destress. Depending on the weather the type of animals would change. Usually
          during warm weather they would bring farm animals that would be outside like horses, goats, chickens, etc and we would pet them and take pictures with the animals. During colder times it would
          just be dogs since the event would be held inside. It was a really nice gesture of them to understand that us college students are very stressed during exams and it really did help us.

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Dorm Essentials</h3>
      <ul>
        There's a bunch of things that you should bring when you move into a dorm (examples in table below). Some seem like they should be common sense but you'd be surprised on how many people don't then they are stuck in a bad
          situation because of it. Certain electronics you should bring are a microwave and a mini fridge. These are essential if you stay on campus most of the time. They just make your life so much easier.
          Next are an alarm clock to make sure you get up on time for work or class and headphones are a must if you cannot study with noise surrounding you. For food it's only examples of what kinds of food you should bring with
          you. They include easy to make quick foods, snacks and healthy options. Clothes options are a must you always have to be ready for that quick weather change with a light jacket, a job interview or class presentation with
          some formal wear and comfortable foot wear for errands. Emergency items are pretty self explanatory, you never know what you'll need. From a scrape to a headache to a female accident or a common cold, its always good to
          have these things around. School items are the most forgotten about things to bring since every student thinks they won't actually need them. In class you always have to be prepared in order to do your best.
