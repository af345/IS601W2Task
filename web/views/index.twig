      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> The Dorms</h3>
      <ul>
        The campus itself was stunning and so were the dorms. Everywhere you went was extremely clean even if it was an older building. In my four years in the university I lived in two dorms which
        were Dinallo Heights and the Village. Dinallo was a traditional dorm style which meant as soon as you walk in it's just a room with a bathroom, that's it. Although it doesn't seem like much
        it was actually really awesome. It was a very modern building which included lounges on every floor and games. Definitely a place for the younger students to hang out anf make friends. The
        Village on the other side was much different. A apartment style dorm which was where the older students and graduate students stayed at. It was less monitored since everyone was older
        so they knew how to behave themselves. Both were great dorms, each with different vibes but for sure worth every single penny paid.

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are following the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php">Getting Started</a> guide, then please head back to the tutorial and follow the next steps!</li>
        <li>If you deployed this app by deploying the Heroku Button, then in a command line shell, run:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>git clone https://github.com/heroku/php-getting-started.git</code> - this will create a local copy of the source code for the app</li>
          <li><code>cd php-getting-started</code> - change directory into the local source code repository</li>
          <li><code>heroku git:remote -a &lt;your-app-name></code> - associate the Heroku app with the repository</li>
          <li>You'll now be set up to run the app locally, or <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#push-local-changes">deploy changes</a> to Heroku</li>
        </ul>

    Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application.  The guide covers the basics of working with Heroku, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
